Heya! Thanks for dropping by!

I’m Nikitha Addala - a budding programmer. I'm currently in 6th semester of B.Tech with Electronics and Communication as my discipline. Always up for a discussion on business, stock trading, crypto, nukes and philosophy.

I believe certifications do not necessarily impart the required knowledge rather building projects does.

I’m currently learning Data Structures using Python and GIT thorugh VSCode.

<!--- Will definitely update this space with more stuff once I gain the required skils. --->
